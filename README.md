# 🎉 Welcome to 10 Practical Projects JS! 🎉
This is a mini summer challenge where I'll be creating and submitting a series of practical JavaScript projects. Each project is designed to enhance my coding skills and explore various aspects of web development.

## Projects:

<ul><li><b>Project 1</b>: To-Do List 📝</li>
    <li><b>Project 2</b>: Take Notes 📒</li>
    <li><b>Project 3</b>: Password strength checker 🔑</li>
</ul>
